        <h1>History</h1>
        <p class="about-blurb">SooShii Revolving Sushi Bar began as a small, family owned eatery in Harajuku district in Japan. As our family grew, our love for sushi prompted us to expand locations.
          This led us to sunny San Diego, California! Nestled in the heart of the vibrant Convoy District, SooShii opened it's first US location in Fall 2007 to an eager crowd of sushi lovers. We've been voted
          Reader's #1 Choice since 2010, and continue a tradition of serving the freshest fish, flavorful ramen, and boldest flavors. We love to expand our selections and regularly bring
          new and innovative dishes to our restaurants. Our favorite thing to create is sushi! Check out the menu <a href="menu.html">here</a>, and be sure to stop by for seasonal dishes!</p>

        <h1>About Our Chefs</h1>
        <p class="about-blurb">What makes our sushi so delicious and inventive? We hire the best sushi chefs, of course! Our diverse chefs are selected for the sushi line and are sent for all-expenses 
          paid training in Japan at the <a href="https://sushischool.jp/" target="_blank">Tokyo Sushi Academy</a> in Tsukiji, Japan to learn from the very best sushi chefs. Upon sucessful completion
        of the training program, chefs return and present their own individual creations for consideration to be added to our menu. Our chefs always bring unique and beautiful flavors to reflect 
        the diversity and beauty of all the different people who love sushi, so we love sharing these amazing flavor fusions with our guests!</p>
